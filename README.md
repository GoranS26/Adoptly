# 🐾 Adoptly

**Adoptly** is a work-in-progress iOS app that helps connect animal shelters with people looking to adopt pets.  
The goal is to modernize the adoption experience by offering a clean, user-friendly interface that supports both adopters and shelters.

---

## 💡 Motivation

While researching pet adoption, I noticed that many platforms are outdated, hard to use, or not optimized for mobile. As an animal lover and iOS enthusiast, I decided to build an app that simplifies the process and brings value to both adopters and shelters.

## 📱 Features (Planned)

- 🔑 Role selection (Adopter or Shelter)
- 🐶 Browse adoptable pets
- ❤️ Save favorite animals
- 📍 Locate shelters nearby
- 💬 Contact shelters directly
- 🧾 Shelter dashboard to manage listed animals

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- MVVM architecture 
- Core Data (for storing favorites)
- Possibly MapKit & Firebase later on

---

## 🚧 Current Status

Adoptly is in the **early stages of development**. I'm actively working on core UI components and user flows for adopters and shelters. This project is part of my learning journey in iOS development.
This project will be private until MVP(Demo) is ready/.
